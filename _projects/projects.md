<!-- [My GitHub Project](https://github.com/username/repository) -->

I am listing my favourite projects here. My github contains many more projects but they may not be properly documented.

Master's Project - ScaleFL Visualization
======

* Ongoing project - Aug 2024 ‑ Dec 2024
* Modified the existing ScaleFL source code to generate comprehensive visualization reports for comparisons on model architectures, summaries, execution times and model parameters for  various clients in a resource‑adaptive Federated Learning setup
* Modified existing code to allow the user to input well‑defined client‑level complexities per level instead of a heuristic determination
* Gained knowledge on early exit classifiers and parameter scaling. Technologies used : python, pytorch, matplotlib
* Code - Will be made available in the future



Internet Systems Projects
======

* Hadoop Chunk Size Optimization
  * Conducted experiments on optimizing hadoop chunk size
  * Measure performance for various chunk sizes for a large dataset of text files. Compare the inbuilt mapreduce algorithms - grep and wordcount
  * Code - [Code](https://github.com/SathvikKP/Hadoop_Chunk_Size)


* Toy WebCrawler with Analysis
  * Utilized scrapy to create a WebCrawler that crawls GeorgiaTech web pages for analysis purpose.
  * Perform analysis of the scraped websites and calculate statistics
  * Code - [Code](https://github.com/SathvikKP/web_crawler)


* OpenChord DHT Runtime Measurement
  * Conducted experiments to measure insertion and lookup runtimes for OpenChord. Also measure the RAM and other statistics.
  * Compare the performance for different number of peers. Use a simple key value pair for testing purposes.
  * Code -  [Code](https://github.com/SathvikKP/OpenChordTests)



AI and Machine Learning Projects
======

* Critical Event Anomaly Detection  (Oct 2024 ‑ Dec 2024)
  * Developed a video anomaly detection system for car dash cam footage using a combination of unsupervised and supervised learning.
  * Numerous technologies and python libraries used including keras and tensorflow. ML algorithms included KMeans, GMMs, AutoEncoders and Multivariate Gaussians. Achieved an F1 score of 0.8 with very limited training.
  * Code - Coming soon


* Fine tuning LLMs for Language Translation and Medical Diagnosis (Oct 2024 ‑ Dec 2024)
  * Fine tuned Facebook mbart and Google mt5 models for translation between English and Hindi languages.
  * Numerous technologies and python libraries used including transformers, pytorch, nltk. Increased BERTScore by 5%.
  * Translation followed by Medical diagnosis using fine tuned Mistral and Llama models. Improved differential accuracy by over 20%.
  * [Code](https://github.com/SathvikKP/LLM_Translation_Eng_Hindi)


* Machine Learning Fundamentals for Big Data Systems (Fall 2024)
  * Random Forest Algorithm Analysis - A comprehensive evaluation of random forst algorithm, and comparision with various other algorithms. View the complete details and code at [Code](https://github.com/SathvikKP/Random_forests_analysis)
  * CNN Hyperparameter Tuning - A comprehensive method for tuning hyperparameters, analysis with edge cases for MNIST dataset. View the complete details and code at [Code](https://github.com/SathvikKP/CNN_Hyperparameter_MNIST)
  * Ensemble Learning Analysis - A comprehensive evaluation of ensemble permutations for 4 SOTA models - ResNet, DenseNet, VGG16 and MobileNetV2. View the complete details and code at [Code](https://github.com/SathvikKP/Ensemble_Learning_CIFAR10)


  
Simple Full Stack Web applications 
======

Undergraduate College course projects (2019 ‑ 2020)
* Timetable Generator app ‑ Designed logic for generating college timetables. Technologies used include python and flask. [Code](https://github.com/SathvikKP/DBMSProject)
* Book Store app ‑ Developed a web app using springboot that tracks books purchased and issues notification events. [Code](https://github.com/username/repository)
* Workshop Organization app ‑ Developed a MEAN app that registers and tracks workshops across different locations. [Code](https://github.com/SathvikKP/Java-MicroServices-Project)
