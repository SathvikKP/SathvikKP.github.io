Master's Project - ScaleFL Visualization
======

* Ongoing project - Aug 2024 ‑ Dec 2024
* Modified the existing ScaleFL source code to generate comprehensive visualization reports for comparisons on model architectures, summaries, client curves, model weight box plots, client execution times and model parameters for various clients in a resource‑adaptive Federated Learning setup
* Modified existing code to allow the user to input well‑defined client‑level complexities per level instead of a heuristic determination
* Gained knowledge on early exit classifiers and parameter scaling. Technologies used : python, pytorch, matplotlib
* Code - Will be made available in the future


AI and Machine Learning Projects
======

* LayerSkip Optimization: Pruning and Early Exit for LLM Inference (Spring 2025)
  * Extended Meta's LayerSkip architecture by implementing angular distance-based pruning and randomized dropout, reducing inference time by up to 50% on datasets like CNN/DM and HumanEval while maintaining 90%+ acceptance rates.
  * Used PyTorch for zeroing linear layers based on angular distances; compared tradeoffs with early exits, achieving 2x speedups with minimal accuracy loss (e.g., ROUGE scores within 10% of baseline).
  * Evaluated on tasks including summarization and coding. Technologies: PyTorch, Hugging Face (Llama-2 7B). 
  * Code - Private


* Speech Recognition for Kannada using LSTM (Deep Learning, Sept 2022)
  * An ASR system for Kannada language was developed using LSTMs. Technologies used include Kaldi, bash and python.
  * Analyzed effects of batch size, hidden layer dimension, and number of LSTM layers on WER. Accuracy of 97% achieved
  * Developed a new pre‑processing method to achieve efficient transliteration of special characters and nasal sounds.
  * Code - Private, Paper - [link]{https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-99-5974-7_17}

* Federated Learning for Video Anomaly Detection (June 2022)
